# Open Landslide Project (OLP)

The Open Landslide Project (OLP) is an initiative focused on advancing research in the field of geosciences. Its primary objective is to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing by establishing an open-source landslide inventory. We firmly believe that a comprehensive dataset not only facilitates geostatistical analysis but is also an essential resource for progressing research in landslide risk management.
The project is inherently committed to promoting transparency and accessibility in data sharing within the broader geoscience community. By offering researchers a platform to access and utilize the landslide dataset, the OLP aims to catalyze advancements in understanding landslide dynamics, thereby contributing to more effective strategies for risk mitigation and disaster response.
Moreover, we extend a warm invitation to researchers worldwide to join us in our dedication to open data. The Open Landslide Project welcomes and encourages researchers to leverage our open-source inventory and share their findings by uploading them to the OLP repository, either in georeferenced vector format or as a link to their own data on external repositories. Embracing this inclusive approach to data sharing, the OLP seeks to create a dynamic hub for research, reducing the time required for data collection. We are confident that this open exchange of information will not only enhance the capabilities of the scientific community but also foster a spirit of cooperation in addressing the challenges of landslide risk management on a global scale.
